# Intro
GDorker is a web scraper which scrapes Google URL's and is made purely with Python-3. It has two main scraping options:

## Query dorking
Scrapes URL's displayed in google for a specific search query given by the user and saves it to a file  named 'links.txt' and also prints the url in the  terminal. It also asks you how many top url's to scrape according to your requirements.

## Website dorking
Scrapes a website. After the URL of a website is given it searches for indexed links for:
- Directory lisiting vulnerabilities
- Configuration files exposed
- Database files exposed
- Log files exposed
- Backup and old files
- Login pages
- SQL errors
- Publicly exposed documents
- PHPinfo() files<br>
then register's the  results in a html file with the website's URL in its file name.
